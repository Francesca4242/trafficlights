# trafficlights
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is code for a website that interacts with an arduino- making it turn red, orange and green in conjunction with the traffic light that appears on the screen
=======
Traffic lights is a program that contains arduino code, python and html. It uses flask to create a web server that will send orders to your arduino dependent on what button is clicked in the webserver application. This in turn will light up a section of the strip lighting. This is programmed to work with a windows laptop sending signals to COM3. This has the potential to be developed into further more complicated games or arrays in the lighting mechanism.
